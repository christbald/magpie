<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
  Configuration files are used to configure model instances, created within a job.
  This is also called the parametrization of a model. MAGPIE uses the configuration
  files for both generating the
  <b><a href="help?section=<%= section %>#configuration_input_form">configuration input forms</a></b>
  and creating the
  <b><a href="help?section=<%= section %>#configuration_instance_files">configuration instance files</a></b>
  used within a model run.

</p>

<h4>General</h4>
<p>
  Before starting a job (project creation or within a project itself) MAGPIE is
  collecting all config files associated with the project corresponding model.
  To make MAGPIE recognizing a config file the filename extension is supposed
  to be <b>.config</b>. The filename itself can be chosen arbitrary.
  Within these config files the form output is created. More details on the form
  creation can be found in section
  <a href="help?section=<%= section %>#configuration_input_form">configuration input forms</a>.
  When the form input is finished, MAGPIE is collecting all information made by the user
  and creates the corresponding
  <a href="help?section=<%= section %>#configuration_instance_files">configuration instance files</a>.
  These files can be used by the model itself for read-in and usage of the particular instance.
</p>

<div id="configuration_input_form"><h4>Configuration Input Forms</h4>

  <h5> Structure </h5>
  <p>
    Every single element of the form consists of two lines in the corresponding
    config file. The <b>first line</b> is a <b>comment</b>, beginning with <b>#</b>
    and is used for the tooltip box in the config input form. The second line
    consists of all relevant information describing the parameter.
    Therefore, the most simple structure looks like the following:
    <pre>
      #COMMENT
      NAME TYPE DEFAULT (ADDITIONALS)
    </pre>
    MAGPIE supports the following types:
    <li>string</li>
    <li>numeric</li>
    <li>integer</li>
    <li>float</li>
    <li>double</li>
    <li>dropdown</li>
    <li>file</li>
    All possible types and how they are used is shown within the
    <b><a href="help?section=<%= section %>#configuration_example"> "Configuration Example" Model</a></b>.
  </p>

  <h5> Conditionals </h5>
  <p>
    Conditionals can be used to build switches within a config file.
    This gives the possiblity to show / hide configuration inputs in a form
    based on a dropdown menu.
    <pre>
      CONDITIONAL AS CODE
    </pre>

## Why should I use PLIP?

#### Comprehensive Detection of Interaction
* Eight types of noncovalent interactions
* Interaction between proteins and
  * small molecules
  * ions
  * polymers
  * DNA / RNA
* Rich additiona information on binding, e.g. unpaired functional groups

#### Everything Is Automated

* Direct download of PDB structures from PDB server
* Automatic detection and grouping of relevant ligands in a PDB file
* No need for special preparation of a PDB file, works out of the box
* Automatic fixiing of errors in PDB files

#### Flexible Usage
* Processing of custom PDB files containing protein-ligand complexes (e.g. from docking)
* Atom-level interaction reports in TXT and XML formats for easy parsing
* Generation of PyMOL session files (.pse), enabling easy preparation of images for publications and talks
* Rendering of 3D interaction diagram for each ligand and its interactions with the protein

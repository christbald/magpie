## How do I integrate a SBML model myself?

#### General
* download any (manually) curated SBML model (e.g. from BioModels)
* check for SBML **L2 V3** or **L3 V1**
* register new model in MAGPIE by putting the xml (SBML) file instead of a zip

#### Model Adaptations
In case you want to adapt the graphical output or
modify the model you can do the following:
* download the model within the model overview
* unzip the model and modify as you wish
* zip the model and update the model within MAGPIE
